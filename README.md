## What I learned with this project?

This was an amazing project. I fixed a lot of concepts from OOP, navigation between the screens, and how to create a splash/loading screen, and more importantly: how to fetch data from the internet (in this case, the OpenWeatherMap API), and how to get the current user location from the device GPS.

Well, this project brought me a lot of experience solving bugs and working with platform specific things, such permissions (to acesss the GPS, internet), AndroidX support and adaptive icons in Android.

I want to improve this app in the future, soon as I learn more interesting things from Flutter.
